*The Kotlin Ethereum Virtual Machine*

This is an standalone implementation of the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://www.ethereum.org/) written in Kotlin.

It eventually aims to be a complete standalone web3 implementation in the style of [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) suitable for test purposes but written natively for the JVM in Kotlin.

Currently in a pretty rough state.
